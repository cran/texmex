---------------------------------- Version 1.1 ----------------------------------

This version fixes a few bugs and adds parametric bootstrap functionality for
gpd modelling.

Changes from version 1.0:

1. bootgpd and methods added.
2. gpd was not passing 'start' through to gpd.fit. Fixed.
3. Rationalized summary.gpd and its methods into a single script (no impact).
4. summary.gpd did the wrong simulation when covariates were in the model. Fixed.
5. Bug in qqgpd caused x and y values to be reversed. The y-axis is scaled to 
   accomodate the simulated envelope and this meant that outliers could be
   excluded from the plot. Fixed.
6. print.summary.predict.mex was showing too many decimal places. Fixed
7. validate.texmex failed on Windows due to / in file path (all tests still
   passed if executed individually). Fixed.
